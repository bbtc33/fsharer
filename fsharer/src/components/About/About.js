	<p className='mw8 center lh-copy'>fsharer is a simple online utility that stores either files or text for a short period of time. It was born out of my frustration for the lack of an easy way to communicate between my phone and my computer. Previously, I would have to resort to emailing myself or texting myself files. Fsharer changes this by acting as a file sharing service, but it only stores your data just long enough for you to download onto another device. It also provides you with a simple link for ease of access. Hopefully fsharer can help you make your life easier as well!</p>
